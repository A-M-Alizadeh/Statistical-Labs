Calculating accuracy of the training set means that you will have to classify each sample in the training set as if it were a test sample; one expects that classification of training samples will perform well, and this may also be used to validate your implementation. Accuracy is defined as the ratio between the number of test samples that are correctly classified, and the total number of test samples. Create a graph using the matplotlib library showing the evolution of the accuracy for different values of k over the test set. Create a second graph to show the evolution of the accuracy for different values of k over the train set and compare the two.\n",
